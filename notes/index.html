          Born into a musical family, Rachmaninoff took up the piano at the age of four. He
          graduated from the
          <a href="/wiki/Moscow_Conservatory" title="Moscow Conservatory">Moscow Conservatory</a> in
          1892, having already composed several piano and orchestral pieces. In 1897, following the
          negative critical reaction to his
          <a href="/wiki/Symphony_No._1_(Rachmaninoff)" title="Symphony No. 1 (Rachmaninoff)"
            >Symphony No. 1</a
          >, Rachmaninoff entered a four-year depression and composed little until successful
          therapy allowed him to complete his enthusiastically received
          <a

          >
          in 1901. In the course of the next sixteen years, Rachmaninoff conducted at the
          <a href="/wiki/Bolshoi_Theatre" title="Bolshoi Theatre">Bolshoi Theatre</a>, relocated to
          <a href="/wiki/Dresden" title="Dresden">Dresden</a>, Germany, and toured the United States
          for the first time. Rachmaninoff often featured the piano in his compositions, and he
          explored the expressive possibilities of the instrument through his own skills as a
          pianist.

          Following the

          Rachmaninoff and his family left Russia. They settled in
          <a href="/wiki/New_York_City" title="New York City">New York City</a> in 1918. With his
          main source of income coming from piano and conducting performances, demanding tour
          schedules led to a reduction in his time for composition. Between 1918 and 1943, he
          completed just six works, including

          Rachmaninoff's family had strong musical and military leanings. His paternal grandfather,
          Arkady Alexandrovich, was a musician who had taken lessons from Irish composer

          His father, Vasily Arkadyevich Rachmaninoff (1841–1916), was an army officer and amateur
          pianist who married Lyubov Petrovna Butakova (1853–1929), the daughter of a wealthy army
          general who gave her five estates as part of her
          <a href="/wiki/Dowry" title="Dowry">dowry</a>. The couple had three sons and three

          She noticed his ability to reproduce passages from memory without a wrong note. Upon
          hearing news of the boy's gift, Arkady suggested she hire Anna Ornatskaya, a teacher and

          Rachmaninoff's father had to auction off the Oneg estate in 1882 due to his financial
          incompetence; the family's five estates were now reduced to one. Rachmaninoff remained
          critical of his father in later life, describing him as "a wastrel, a compulsive gambler,
          a pathological liar, and a skirt chaser".<sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference"

          In 1883, Ornatskaya arranged for Rachmaninoff, now 10, to study music at the Saint

          turned down the composer's request for assistance in renting a piano and greater privacy

          unproductive summer; he composed one song, "Fate", which later became one of his Twelve
          Songs (Op. 21), and left compositions for a proposed return visit to London

          By 1900, Rachmaninoff had become so self-critical that, despite numerous attempts,
          composing had become near impossible. His aunt then suggested professional help, having
          received successful treatment from a family friend, physician and amateur musician
          <a href="/wiki/Nikolai_Dahl" title="Nikolai Dahl">Nikolai Dahl</a>, to which Rachmaninoff

          Between January and April 1900, Rachmaninoff underwent hypnotherapy and psychotherapy
          sessions with Dahl on a daily basis, specifically structured to improve his sleep
          patterns, mood, and appetite and reignite his desire to compose. That summer, Rachmaninoff
          felt that "new musical ideas began to stir" and successfully resumed composition.<sup

          In the course of his second season as conductor, Rachmaninoff lost interest in his post.

          His piano repertoire was small, which prompted the start of regular practise of his

          During the Scandinavian tour, Rachmaninoff received three offers from the US: to become

          He declined them all, worried about such a commitment in a country he hardly knew and had
          few fond memories of from his debut tour in 1909. Yet Rachmaninoff now considered the
          United States as financially advantageous, as he would not earn enough to support his
          family through composition alone. He was unable to afford the travel fees, but his
          fortunes changed when Russian banker and fellow emigre Alexander Kamenka agreed to give

          In October 1932, Rachmaninoff began a demanding concert season that consisted of 50
          performances. The tour marked the fortieth anniversary of his debut as a pianist, for
          which several of his Russian friends now living in America sent him a scroll and wreath in
          celebration.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTENorris200067_148-0" class="reference"

          The frail economic situation in the US affected the tour and the composer, who performed
          to few sold-out audiences and lost money in his investments and shares. The European leg
          in 1933 saw Rachmaninoff celebrate his sixtieth birthday among fellow musicians and
          friends, after which he retreated to Villa Senar for the summer.<sup

          The 1939–40 concert season saw Rachmaninoff perform fewer concerts than usual, totalling
          43 appearances that were mostly in the US. The tour continued with dates across England,
          after which Rachmaninoff visited his daughter Tatyana in Paris followed by a return to
          Villa Senar. He was unable to perform for a while after slipping on the floor at the villa
          and injuring himself. He recovered enough to perform at the Lucerne International Music
          Festival on 11 August 1939. It was to be his final concert in Europe. He returned to Paris
          two days later, where Rachmaninoff, his wife, and two daughters were together for the last

          Rachmaninoff's health rapidly declined in the last week of March 1943. He was turned off
          by food, had constant pain in his arms and sides, and found it increasingly difficult to
          breathe. On 26 March, the composer lost consciousness and he died two days later, four
          days before his seventieth birthday.<sup

          In August 2015, Russia announced its intention to seek reburial of Rachmaninoff's remains
          in Russia, claiming that Americans have neglected the composer's grave while attempting to
          "shamelessly privatize" his name. The composer's descendants have resisted this idea,
          pointing out that he died in the U.S. after spending decades outside of Russia in
          self-imposed political exile.<sup id="cite_ref-Radio_Free_Europe_175-0" class="reference"

          The nature of their relationship bordered on romantic, but was primarily intellectual and

          <span class="nowrap">No. 1</span> in D minor, Op.&nbsp;13 (1895),
          <span class="nowrap">No. 2</span> in E minor, Op.&nbsp;27 (1907), and
          <span class="nowrap">No. 3</span> in A minor, Op.&nbsp;44 (1935–36). Widely spaced
          chronologically, the symphonies represent three distinct phases in his compositional
          development. The Second has been the most popular of the three since its first

          Rachmaninoff's style showed initially the influence of
          <a href="/wiki/Pyotr_Ilyich_Tchaikovsky" title="Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky">Tchaikovsky</a>.
          Beginning in the mid-1890s, his compositions began showing a more individual tone. His
          First Symphony has many original features. Its brutal gestures and uncompromising power of
          expression were unprecedented in Russian music at the time. Its flexible
          <a href="/wiki/Rhythm" title="Rhythm">rhythms</a>, sweeping lyricism and stringent economy
          of thematic material were all features he kept and refined in subsequent works. After the
          three fallow years following the poor reception of the symphony, Rachmaninoff's style
          began developing significantly. He started leaning towards sumptuous
          <a href="/wiki/Harmony" title="Harmony">harmonies</a> and broadly lyrical, often
          passionate melodies. His orchestration became subtler and more varied, with textures
          carefully contrasted, and his writing on the whole became more concise.<sup

        <p>
          Especially important is Rachmaninoff's use of unusually widely spaced chords for bell-like
          sounds: this occurs in many pieces, most notably in the
          <a href="/wiki/Choral_symphony" title="Choral symphony">choral symphony</a>
          <i>The Bells</i>, the Second Piano Concerto, the E-flat major
          <i>Étude-Tableaux</i> (Op.&nbsp;33, <span class="nowrap">No. 7</span>), and the B minor
          Prelude (Op.&nbsp;32, <span class="nowrap">No. 10</span>). "It is not enough to say that
          the church bells of Novgorod, St Petersburg and Moscow influenced Rachmaninov and feature
          prominently in his music. This much is self-evident. What is extraordinary is the variety
          of bell sounds and breadth of structural and other functions they fulfill."<sup

          He was also fond of Russian Orthodox chants. He used them most perceptibly in his
          <i>Vespers</i>, but many of his melodies found their origins in these chants. The opening
          melody of the First Symphony is derived from chants. (The opening melody of the Third
          Piano Concerto, on the other hand, is not derived from chants; when asked, Rachmaninoff
          said that "it had written itself".)<sup id="cite_ref-183" class="reference"

          Rachmaninoff's frequently used motifs include the
          <i><a href="/wiki/Dies_Irae" class="mw-redirect" title="Dies Irae">Dies Irae</a></i
          >, often just the fragments of the first phrase. Rachmaninoff had great command of
          <a href="/wiki/Counterpoint" title="Counterpoint">counterpoint</a> and
          <a href="/wiki/Fugue" title="Fugue">fugal</a> writing, thanks to his studies with Taneyev.
          The above-mentioned occurrence of the <i>Dies Irae</i> in the
          <a href="/wiki/Symphony_No._2_(Rachmaninoff)" title="Symphony No. 2 (Rachmaninoff)"
            >Second Symphony</a
          >
          (1907) is but a small example of this. Very characteristic of his writing is
          <a href="/wiki/Chromatic_scale" title="Chromatic scale">chromatic</a> counterpoint. This
          talent was paired with a confidence in writing in both large- and small-scale forms. The

          especially shows a structural ingenuity, while each of the preludes grows from a tiny
          melodic or rhythmic fragment into a taut, powerfully evocative miniature, crystallizing a
          particular mood or sentiment while employing a complexity of texture, rhythmic flexibility
          and a pungent chromatic harmony.<sup id="cite_ref-ng715_184-0" class="reference"

          His compositional style had already begun changing before the
          <a href="/wiki/October_Revolution" title="October Revolution">October Revolution</a>
          deprived him of his homeland. The
          <a href="/wiki/Harmony" title="Harmony">harmonic</a> writing in <i>The Bells</i> was
          composed in 1913 but not published until 1920. This may have been due to Rachmaninoff's
          main publisher, Gutheil, having died in 1914 and Gutheil's catalog being acquired by
          <a href="/wiki/Serge_Koussevitsky" class="mw-redirect" title="Serge Koussevitsky"

          It became as advanced as in any of the works Rachmaninoff would write in Russia, partly
          because the melodic material has a harmonic aspect which arises from its

          Further changes are apparent in the revised

            title="Piano Concerto No. 1 (Rachmaninoff)"
            >First Piano Concerto</a

          His near-<a href="/wiki/Impressionism" title="Impressionism">Impressionist</a> style
          perfectly matched the texts by

          The Op.&nbsp;39 Études-Tableaux are among the most demanding pieces he wrote for any
          medium, both technically and in the sense that the player must see beyond any technical
          challenges to a considerable array of emotions, then unify all these aspects.<sup

          The composer's friend Vladimir Wilshaw noticed this compositional change continuing in the
          early 1930s, with a difference between the sometimes very extroverted Op.&nbsp;39
          Études-Tableaux (the composer had broken a string on the piano at one performance) and the
          <i
            ><a

              >Variations on a Theme of Corelli</a
            ></i
          >
          (Op.&nbsp;42, 1931). The variations show an even greater textural clarity than in the
          Op.&nbsp;38 songs, combined with a more abrasive use of chromatic harmony and a new
          rhythmic incisiveness. This would be characteristic of all his later works—the
          <a

          (Op.&nbsp;40, 1926) is composed in a more emotionally introverted style, with a greater
          clarity of texture. Nevertheless, some of his most beautiful (nostalgic and melancholy)
          melodies occur in the

          <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Yasser" title="Joseph Yasser">Joseph Yasser</a>, as early as 1951,
          uncovered progressive tendencies in Rachmaninoff's compositions. He uncovered
          Rachmaninoff's use of an intra-tonal
          <a href="/wiki/Chromaticism" title="Chromaticism">chromaticism</a> that stands in notable
          contrast to the inter-tonal chromaticism of

          Yasser postulated that a variable, subtle, but unmistakable characteristic use of this

          Rachmaninoff possessed extremely large hands, with which he could easily maneuver through
          the most complex chordal configurations. His left hand technique was unusually powerful.
          His playing was marked by <i>definition</i>—where other pianists' playing became
          blurry-sounding from overuse of the pedal or deficiencies in finger technique,
          Rachmaninoff's textures were always crystal clear. Only Josef Hofmann and Josef Lhévinne
          shared this kind of clarity with him.<sup id="cite_ref-192" class="reference"

          The two pieces Rachmaninoff singled out for praise from Rubinstein's concerts became
          cornerstones for his own recital programs. The compositions were Beethoven's

          and Chopin's <i>Funeral March</i> Sonata. He may have based his interpretation of the
          Chopin sonata on that of Rubinstein. Rachmaninoff biographer Barrie Martyn points out
          similarities between written accounts of Rubinstein's interpretation and Rachmaninoff's

          Coupled to this tone was a vocal quality not unlike that attributed to Chopin's playing.
          With Rachmaninoff's extensive operatic experience, he was a great admirer of fine singing.
          As his records demonstrate, he possessed a tremendous ability to make a musical line sing,
          no matter how long the notes or how complex the supporting texture, with most of his
          interpretations taking on a narrative quality. With the stories he told at the keyboard
          came multiple voices—a
          <a href="/wiki/Polyphony" title="Polyphony">polyphonic</a> dialogue, not the least in
          terms of dynamics. His 1940 recording of his transcription of the song "Daisies" captures
          this quality extremely well. On the recording, separate musical strands enter as if from
          various human voices in eloquent conversation. This ability came from an exceptional
          independence of fingers and hands.<sup

          Rachmaninoff also possessed an uncanny memory—one that would help put him in good stead
          when he had to learn the standard piano repertoire as a 45-year-old exile. He could hear a
          piece of music, even a symphony, then play it back the next day, the next year, or a
          decade after that. Siloti would give him a long and demanding piece to learn, such as
          Brahms'

          Regardless of the music, Rachmaninoff always planned his performances carefully. He based
          his interpretations on the theory that each piece of music has a "culminating point."
          Regardless of where that point was or at which dynamic within that piece, the performer
          had to know how to approach it with absolute calculation and precision; otherwise, the
          whole construction of the piece could crumble and the piece could become disjointed. This
          was a practice he learned from Russian bass
          <a href="/wiki/Feodor_Chaliapin" title="Feodor Chaliapin">Feodor Chaliapin</a>, a staunch
          friend.<sup id="cite_ref-ng714_191-1" class="reference"

          >
          Paradoxically, Rachmaninoff often sounded like he was improvising, though he actually was
          not. While his interpretations were mosaics of tiny details, when those mosaics came
          together in performance, they might, according to the tempo of the piece being played, fly
          past at great speed, giving the impression of instant thought.<sup
            id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEHarrison2006268_201-0"

        <p>
          One advantage Rachmaninoff had in this building process over most of his contemporaries
          was in approaching the pieces he played from the perspective of a composer rather than
          that of an interpreter. He believed "interpretation demands something of the creative
          instinct. If you are a composer, you have an affinity with other composers. You can make
          contact with their imaginations, knowing something of their problems and their ideals. You
          can give their works <i>color</i>. That is the most important thing for me in my
          interpretations, <i>color</i>. So you make music live. Without color it is dead."<sup

          Nevertheless, Rachmaninoff also possessed a far better sense of structure than many of his
          contemporaries, such as Hofmann, or the majority of pianists from the previous generation,
          judging from their respective recordings.<sup

          A recording which showcases Rachmaninoff's approach is the
          <a href="/wiki/Franz_Liszt" title="Franz Liszt">Liszt</a> Second Polonaise, recorded in
          1925. <a href="/wiki/Percy_Grainger" title="Percy Grainger">Percy Grainger</a>, who had

          <a href="/wiki/Ferruccio_Busoni" title="Ferruccio Busoni">Ferruccio Busoni</a>, had
          himself recorded the same piece a few years earlier. Rachmaninoff's performance is far
          more taut and concentrated than Grainger's. The Russian's drive and monumental conception
          bear a considerable difference to the Australian's more delicate perceptions. Grainger's
          textures are elaborate. Rachmaninoff shows the filigree as essential to the work's
          structure, not simply decorative.<sup

          <i>Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine</i>, by Ramachandran and Aronson differed
          greatly from Young's speculation:

            The size of [Rachmaninov's] hands may have been a manifestation of Marfan's syndrome,
            their size and slenderness typical of
            <a href="/wiki/Arachnodactyly" title="Arachnodactyly">arachnodactyly</a>. However,
            Rachmaninov did not clearly exhibit any of the other clinical characteristics typical of
            Marfan's, such as <a href="/wiki/Scoliosis" title="Scoliosis">scoliosis</a>,
            <a href="/wiki/Pectus_excavatum" title="Pectus excavatum">pectus excavatum</a>, and eye
            or cardiac complications. Nor did he express any of the clinical effects of a
            Marfan-related syndrome, such as Beal's syndrome (<a
              href="/wiki/Congenital_contractural_arachnodactyly"

            >), Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, homocystinuria, Stickler syndrome, or Sphrintzen-Goldberg
            syndrome. There is no indication that his immediate family had similar hand spans,
            ruling out familial arachnodactyly. Rachmaninov did not display any signs of digital
            clubbing or any obvious hypertrophic skin changes associated with pachydermoperiostitis.

          <p>
            <a href="/wiki/Acromegaly" title="Acromegaly">Acromegaly</a> is an alternative
            diagnosis. From photographs of Rachmaninov in the 1920s and his portrait by Konstantin
            Somov in 1925 (Figure 1), at a time when he was recording his four piano concerti, the
            coarse facial features of acromegaly are not immediately apparent. However, a case can
            be made from later photographs... During a heavy concert schedule in Russia in 1912, he
            interrupted his schedule because of stiffness in his hands. This may have been due to
            overuse, although carpal tunnel syndrome or simply swelling and puffiness of the hands
            associated with acromegaly may have been the cause. In 1942, Rachmaninov made a final
            revision of his troublesome Fourth Concerto but composed no more new music. A rapidly
            progressing melanoma forced him to break off his 1942–1943 concert tour after a recital
            in Knoxville, Tennessee. A little over five weeks later he died in the house he had
            bought the year before on Elm Drive in Beverly Hills. Melanoma is associated with
            acromegaly and may have been a final clue to Rachmaninov's diagnosis.

          Contrary to rumors that he was "six and a half feet" (198&nbsp;cm), Rachmaninoff's height
          is documented in two U.S. Immigration manifests at
          <a href="/wiki/Ellis_Island" title="Ellis Island">Ellis Island</a>, on 10 November 1918

          However, conductor Eugene Ormandy, who teamed with Rachmaninoff in many piano and
          orchestra performances, recalled in 1979: "He [Rachmaninoff] was about six feet-three (190

          Many of Rachmaninoff's recordings are acknowledged classics. In 1919, Rachmaninoff
          recorded a selection of piano pieces for

          However, staff at the Edison recording studio in New York City asked Edison to reconsider
          his dismissive position, resulting in a limited contract for ten released sides.
          Rachmaninoff recorded on a Lauter concert grand piano, one of the few the company made. He
          felt his performances varied in quality and requested final approval prior to a commercial
          release. Edison agreed, but still issued multiple takes, an unusual practice which was
          standard at Edison Records, where strict company policy demanded three good takes of each
          piece in case of damage or wear to the masters. Rachmaninoff and Edison Records were
          pleased with the released discs and wished to record more, but Edison refused, saying the
          ten sides were sufficient.

          In an article for <i>Gramophone</i>, April 1931, Rachmaninoff defended an earlier stated
          view on the musical value of radio, about which he was sceptical: "the modern gramophone
          and modern methods of recording are musically superior to wireless transmission in every
          way".<sup id="cite_ref-Gramophone_213-0" class="reference"

          His sister-in-law, Sofia Satina, remembered him at the family estate at Ivanovka,

          most probably the Aeolian Company's Berlin subsidiary, the Choralion Company. Aeolian in
          London created a set of three rolls of this concerto in 1909, which remained in the

          punched paper could provide an accurate record, so he was invited to listen to a proof
          copy of his first recording. After the performance, he was quoted as saying
          <i>"Gentlemen—I, Sergei Rachmaninoff, have just heard myself play!"</i> For demonstration
          purposes, he recorded the solo part of his Second Piano Concerto for Ampico, though only
